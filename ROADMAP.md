## Overview

The Insurance Comparator aims to help users compare various insurance products by visualizing and processing key data elements. This roadmap outlines the next steps to enhance the application by incorporating new data visualization and data processing functionalities.

---

## Feature Ideas

### Coverage Comparison Chart

- **Description**: Visualize and compare different insurance products based on their coverage areas (e.g., medical expenses, accident protection, dental, hospitalization).
- **Implementation Ideas**:
  - Map coverage items from various insurers to a standardized list.
  - Provide interactive charts (e.g., radar or bar charts) that allow users to select and compare specific coverage items.
  - Ensure responsiveness and clarity across different devices.

---

### Premium vs. Coverage Visualization

- **Description**: Compare the cost of insurance premiums against the amount of coverage offered to assess value.
- **Implementation Ideas**:
  - Use bubble charts or bar charts where the x-axis represents the premium and the y-axis represents the coverage amount.
  - Optionally, include additional factors (e.g., user ratings) as bubble size or color intensity.
  - Calculate and display ratios such as "coverage amount per premium unit" for quick comparisons.

---

### Anomaly Detection

- **Description**: Identify and flag outlier data points that may indicate errors or require further review (e.g., abnormally high premiums or low coverage amounts).
- **Implementation Ideas**:
  - Utilize statistical methods (mean, standard deviation) or machine learning techniques to detect anomalies.
  - Implement automated alerts for admins when outliers are detected.
  - Provide a dashboard for administrators to review and manage flagged data.

---

### Data Standardization

- **Description**: Ensure consistency in data presentation by standardizing terminology and format across different insurance providers.
- **Implementation Ideas**:
  - Develop a mapping table to unify different terms used by various insurers.
  - Automate data transformation during data ingestion or as a scheduled batch process.
  - Design an admin interface to update and manage mapping rules as new data or insurance products are introduced.

---

## Future Plans

- **AI-Powered Recommendation System**: Consider integrating an AI model to provide personalized insurance recommendations based on user profiles and preferences. (Planned for later phases)

## Notes

- This roadmap is a living document and may be updated as new ideas emerge or priorities shift.
- Collaborators are encouraged to provide feedback or propose additional features via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.
